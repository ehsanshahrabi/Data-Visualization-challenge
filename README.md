Analysis
Pymaceuticals, Inc. recently conducted an animal study on 249 mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors, focusing on the effects of various drug regimens, including the company's drug of interest, Capomulin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of Capomulin against other treatment regimens over 45 days.

Following a data cleansing process, a duplicate mouse (ID g989) was identified, reducing the total number of mice to 248. The gender distribution showed a slightly higher number of male mice compared to female mice.

Capomulin and Ramicane were the most tested drug regimens, while Propriva was the least tested. Analysis of potential outliers revealed no outliers for Capomulin and Ramicane, but one outlier for Infubinol (mouse ID 15 with a tumor volume of 36.321346 mm3) and none for Capomulin ,Ceftamin, and Ramicane.

Box plot analysis indicated that Capomulin and Ramicane were more effective in reducing tumor volume than Infubinol and Ceftamin. The red dot in the Infubinol plot signifies the presence of an outlier.

A scatter plot examining the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume demonstrated a positive correlation, indicating that heavier mice tend to have larger tumors. The correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.84, implying a strong positive relationship between the two variables.

In conclusion, Capomulin emerged as the most effective drug regimen in this study based on mean tumor volume, median tumor volume, tumor volume variance, tumor volume standard deviation, and tumor volume standard error. Capomulin demonstrated the lowest values in these categories, while Zoniferol exhibited the highest values, making it the least effective drug regimen among those tested. Further studies are recommended to confirm these findings and to explore the long-term effects of Capomulin on squamous cell carcinoma in mice.
